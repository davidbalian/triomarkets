To run this app,

You will need to have node installed on your machine.

Open the server folder using a terminal, and run the following commands:
1. npm i
2. node index

The above code will start the server. It will log to the console the port that it is running on.

Open the list folder using a terminal, and run the following commands:
1. npm i
2. npm run dev

Then click the link that will be displayed in the cli, to open the app in the browser.

The app should work now.

If it doesn't contact me.
